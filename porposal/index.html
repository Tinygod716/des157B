        I want to create an interactive digital experience that links geography and cultural understanding. The main concept is a 2D world map interface where users can click on different countries or regions to trigger a 3D model that rises from the selected location. Each model will represent an iconic cultural or environmental element related to that area — such as architectural landmarks, traditional artifacts, or natural landscapes.
Alongside the 3D visualization, an informational panel will appear to present more detailed content about the region’s cultural background, geographic information, climate, and local customs. This integration of spatial interaction and cultural storytelling seeks to offer users a more immersive and intuitive way to explore global diversity.
The project will be designed with a focus on educational accessibility and visual engagement, using web technologies such as JavaScript (with Three.js for 3D rendering), HTML/CSS, and interactive mapping libraries like Leaflet or Mapbox. The goal is to make geographic and cultural learning more dynamic and personalized, especially for students and general audiences interested in global studies, anthropology, or design.
Ultimately, this project is not just about displaying data — it is about creating a sensory entry point into the identities of places, encouraging curiosity and appreciation of cultural context through interaction and visualization.
