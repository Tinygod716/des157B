    <h2>1. Latour, Bruno. Down to Earth: Politics in the New Climatic Regime. Polity Press, 2018.</h2>
    <p>Latour introduces the concept of “terrestrial politics,” arguing that traditional political dichotomies are insufficient for addressing the climate crisis. His call for new frameworks to understand the relationship between humans and the planet provides a philosophical foundation for your speculative governance model.</p>

    <h2>2. Tsing, Anna. The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in Capitalist Ruins. Princeton University Press, 2015.</h2>
    <p>
        Tsing explores alternative modes of collaboration and survival in the ruins of capitalism, using the matsutake mushroom as a metaphor. Her non-linear narrative and post-anthropocentric perspective can inspire your design of a speculative future society

        3. Manovich, Lev. The Language of New Media. MIT Press, 2001.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Manovich outlines five key principles of new media, including interactivity and variability. These concepts are essential for the technical and UX design aspects of your project, guiding your decisions on how users interact with and manipulate the 3D map through the Three.js framework.

        4. MacEachren, Alan M. How Maps Work: Representation, Visualization, and Design. Guilford Press, 1995.
    </h2>

    <p>
        This foundational text in cartographic theory explains how maps encode and communicate information. It provides valuable insight into perception and visual hierarchy, supporting your efforts to design a map that is both visually compelling and rich in speculative meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Deleuze, Gilles, and Félix Guattari. A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. University of Minnesota Press, 1987.</h2>

    <p>
        The authors' concepts of deterritorialization, rhizomatic structures, and nomadic thought offer a theoretical lens for your non-traditional mapping. Their idea of “mapping” as a fluid process (rather than “tracing” static structures) complements your aim to visualize relationships, movement, and shifting identities across geographies.
