    <h1>Capstone Usability Testing & Results</h1>
   </header>

   <article>
     <h2>Three Significant Observations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The animated particle background and rotating rings created a strong first impression and gave users a sense of immersion from the start.</li>
      <li>Some users were unsure about how to interact with the markers and didn’t realize they were clickable, suggesting the hover animation alone wasn't always enough as a visual cue.</li>
      <li>The text animations (using GSAP SplitText) were praised for their cinematic feel, but a few users missed the beginning of the animation because they scrolled too quickly or didn’t realize it was scroll-triggered.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>How the Project Can Be Improved</h2>
    <h3>General Interaction:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a pop-up intro message or tooltip when the user first enters the scene to explain how to interact.</li>
      <li>Make the hover state of markers more visually distinct by adding glowing effects or subtle pulsation.</li>
      <li>Improve scroll behavior by expanding the trigger zones and smoothing out scroll speed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Enhancements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce light movement or flickering background particles to add more visual depth.</li>
      <li>Adjust camera lighting and shadows for each model to better distinguish them from the background.</li>
      <li>Add a brief fade-in/fade-out transition when switching scenes or returning via the “Go Back” button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scene-Specific Feedback:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the default torus shape with custom models for each marker.</li>
      <li>Align text panel designs with the tone of the 3D environment.</li>
      <li>Increase the size and contrast of floating labels or UI prompts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ending Scene:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a visual summary showing which markers were explored and their impact.</li>
      <li>Include subtle background music or sound effects for emotional resonance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Can Users Figure Out How to Navigate/Interact?</h2>
    <p>Some users initially hesitated, but once they scrolled or hovered over the markers, they began to understand the interaction flow. With clearer entry instructions and improved hover states, navigation will feel more intuitive.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Does the Project Impact the User as Intended?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The visual depth, interactive scroll experience, and 3D transitions successfully drew users into the narrative. The feedback shows the project has strong immersive potential.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Modifications Need to Be Made?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance button and marker feedback for clearer guidance.</li>
      <li>Add easing animations to scrolling and transitions.</li>
      <li>Customize models and lighting for stronger narrative ties.</li>
      <li>Animate the final summary scene for a more impactful ending.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Plan to Update the Capstone Based on Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace placeholder 3D models with finalized versions.</li>
      <li>Add a startup guide popup and clearer marker feedback.</li>
      <li>Improve text animation pacing and scroll responsiveness.</li>
      <li>Polish info panels and unify the visual interface.</li>
      <li>Add a summary scene to conclude the experience and give feedback.</li>
    </ul>
