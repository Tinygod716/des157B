    <h1>Capstone Project Case Study</h1>
   </header>
   <article>
  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This capstone project is an interactive Three.js-based memorial webpage designed to create emotional connections through 3D elements, animation, and storytelling. The primary objective was to visualize loss, memory, and personalized digital rituals using custom markers and engaging transitions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Traditional methods of remembering pets or loved ones often lack personalization and interactivity. The challenge was to use web-based 3D experiences to represent memory in a way that felt emotionally resonant and meaningful for users.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The final solution involved a Three.js scene with orbiting elements, interactive markers, animated text using GSAP, and a clean visual style. Users could explore memories by scrolling and clicking, triggering animations and model transitions that mimicked emotional depth and personalization.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Research & Inspiration:</strong> Looked into existing Three.js memorials, digital graveyards, and commemorative apps.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-fidelity Prototypes:</strong> Sketches and simple 3D donut models to test interaction flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-fidelity:</strong> 3D printed elements, laser-cut tests, and GSAP text transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Testers were confused in scene 2, distracted in scene 3. Improvements were logged and prioritized.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The project was well received for its emotional tone and smooth transitions. Users were particularly drawn to the typewriter animation and overall visual atmosphere. However, several areas for improvement were identified, including adding clearer UI feedback, improving scene flow, and redesigning narrative structure.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add highlight and hover feedback to interactive choices.</li>
      <li>Redesign narrative log to improve coherence.</li>
      <li>Add animated visualization of user impact at the end.</li>
      <li>Consider background sounds and voice-overs for context.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This capstone demonstrates how emotion-driven web interactions can provide a space for memory and reflection. By combining 3D environments, storytelling, and animation, the project creates a space that’s personal and engaging—offering new digital rituals for remembrance.</p>
